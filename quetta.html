             <p class="content"> The immediate area has long been one of pastures and mountains, with varied plants and animals relative to the dry plains to the west.

                From 11th century, the land of Quetta was owned and ruled by the Kasi Pashtun tribe. It was captured by Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi during his invasion of South Asia.[10] In 1543, Mughal emperor Humayun came to Quetta en route to Safavid Persia, leaving his son and future Mughal emperor Akbar here. In 1709, the region was a part of Afghan Hotak dynasty and stayed a part until 1747 when Ahmed Shah Durrani conquered it and made it a part of Durrani Empire. The first European visited Quetta in 1828, describing it as mud-walled fort surrounded by three hundred mud houses.[11]
                
                In 1876, Quetta was occupied by the British and subsequently incorporated into British India.[10] In 1856, British General John Jacob had urged his government to occupy Quetta given its strategic position on the western frontier.[12] British troops constructed the infrastructure for their establishment.
