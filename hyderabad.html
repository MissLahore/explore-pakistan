        <p class="content"> Hyderabad (Sindhi: حيدرآباد‎; Urdu: حيدرآباد; /ˈhaɪdərəbɑːd/)[5] is a city and the capital of Hyderabad Division in the Sindh province of Pakistan. It is the second-largest city in Sindh, and the fifth largest in Pakistan.[6]

            Founded in 1768 by Mian Ghulam Shah Kalhoro of the Kalhora Dynasty, Hyderabad served as a provincial capital until the British transferred the capital to Bombay Presidency in 1840. It is about 150 kilometres (93 mi) inland of Karachi, the largest city of Pakistan, to which it is connected by a direct railway and M-9 motorway.
            The city was named in honour of Ali,[7] the fourth caliph and cousin of Muhammad. Hyderabad's name translates literally as "Lion City"—from haydar, meaning "lion", and ābād, which is a suffix indicating a settlement. "Lion" references Ali's valour in battle,[8] so he is often referred to as Ali Haydar, roughly meaning "Ali the Lionheart", by South Asian Muslims.

             <p class="content"> The River Indus was changing course around 1757, resulting in periodic floods of the then capital of the Kalhora dynasty, Khudabad. Mian Ghulam Shah Kalhoro decided to shift the capital away from Khudabad, and founded Hyderabad in 1768 over a limestone ridge on the eastern bank of the Indus River known as Ganjo Takkar, or "Bald Hill." The small hill is traditionally believed to have been the location of the ancient settlement of Neroon Kot, a town which had fallen to the armies of Muhammad Bin Qasim in 711 CE.[9][10] When the foundations were laid, the city came to be known by the nickname Heart of the Mehran.

                Devotees of Imam Ali advised Mian Ghulam Shah Kalhoro to name the city in honour of their Imam.[10] The Shah of Iran later gifted the city a stone which purportedly bears the imprint of Ali's feet.[10] The stone was placed in the Qadamgah Maula Ali, which then became a place of pilgrimage.n 1768, Mian Ghulam Shah Kalhoro ordered a fort to be built on one of the three hills of Hyderabad to house and defend his people.
