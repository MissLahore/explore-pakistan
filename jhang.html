             <p class="content"> The city of Jhang was built in 1288 by Rai Sial, a chief of the Sial tribe.[4][6][3] The Sial tribe, his kin, ruled over this region ever since then until the last Sial ruler of Jhang, Ahmad Khan (1812 to 1822) was defeated by Ranjit Singh after a fierce fighting.[3][7]

                Under the collective rule of the Sial Khans of Jhang and other Sial sub-tribes such as the Rajbana and Bharwana, in the zenith of their power, the Sial country of Jhang extended up to the Muzafargarh boundary in the south, and the entirety of Chiniot, Kamalia and Kabirwala ilakas. The territory extended to parts of Bhakkar and Sargodha. The Garh Mahraja and Ahmadpur Sial ilakas were added to the possessions of the Rajbana Sial tribe who drove out the Baloch tribes to the Thal and defeated the Nawab of Multan by the mid 17th century.[3][5]
                
                Under the British Raj, the towns of Jhang and Mighiana, lying two miles (3.2 km) apart, became a joint municipality, then known as Jhang-Maghiana.[8]
