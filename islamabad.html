        <p class="content">Islamabad (/ɪzˈlɑːməbæd/;[7] Urdu: اسلام‌آباد, romanized: Islāmābād, listenⓘ; transl. 'City of Islam') is the capital city of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.[8] It is the country's ninth-most populous city with a population of over 1.2 million people[5][9] and is federally administered by the Pakistani government as part of the Islamabad Capital Territory. Built as a planned city in the 1960s and established in 1967, it replaced Karachi as Pakistan's national capital.

            The Greek architect Constantinos Apostolou Doxiadis developed Islamabad's master plan, in which he divided it into eight zones; the city comprises administrative, diplomatic enclave, residential areas, educational and industrial sectors, commercial areas, as well as rural and green areas administered by the Islamabad Metropolitan Corporation with support from the Capital Development Authority.

             <p class="content"> Islamabad Capital Territory, located on the Pothohar Plateau of the northern Punjab region, is considered one of the earliest sites of human settlement in Asia.[23] Some of the earliest Stone Age artefacts in the world have been found on the plateau, dating from 100,000 to 500,000 years ago. Rudimentary stones recovered from the terraces of the Soan River testify to the endeavours of early man in the inter-glacial period.[24] Items of pottery and utensils dating back to prehistory have been found.[25]

                Excavations by Dr. Abdul Ghafoor Lone reveal evidence of a prehistoric culture in the area. Relics and human skulls have been found dating back to 5000 BCE that indicate the region was home to Neolithic peoples who settled on the banks of the Soan[23] and who later developed small communities in the region around 3000 BCE.[24][26]
                
                The Indus Valley civilization flourished in the region between the 23rd and 18th centuries BCE.
