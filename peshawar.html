        <p class="content">Peshawar (/pəˈʃɑːwər/;[8] Pashto: پېښور [peˈχəwər] ⓘ; Hindko: پشور; [pɪˈʃɔːɾ] ⓘ; Urdu: پشاور [pɪˈʃɑːʋər] ⓘ) is the sixth most populous city of Pakistan, with a district population of over 4.7 million in the 2023 census. It is the capital of the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where it is the largest city.[9] It is situated in the north-west of the country, lying in the Valley of Peshawar. Peshawar is primarily populated by Pashtuns, who comprise the second-largest ethnic group in the country.[10][11]

            Situated in the Valley of Peshawar, a broad area situated east of the historic Khyber Pass, Peshawar's recorded history dates back to at least 539 BCE, making it one of the oldest cities in South Asia.[12][13] The area encompassing modern-day Peshawar is mentioned in the Vedic scriptures; it was one of the principal cities of the ancient Gāndhāra. Peshawar served as the capital of the Kushan Empire during the rule of Kanishka[14][15][16] and was home to the Kanishka Stupa, which was among the tallest buildings in the ancient world.

             <p class="content"> Peshawar alongside the modern day Ghandara region were found in the Vedic Scripture as Pushkalavati.[37]

                Foundation
                Peshawar was founded as the city of Puruṣapura,[18][38][39] on the Gandhara Plains in the broad Valley of Peshawar in 100 CE.[40][41] It may have been named after a Hindu raja who ruled the city who was known as Purush.[23] The city likely first existed as a small village in the fifth century BCE,[42] within the cultural sphere of ancient India.[43] Puruṣapura was founded near the ancient Gandharan capital city of Pushkalavati, near present-day Charsadda.[44][20]
                
                Greek rule
                In the winter of 327–26 BCE, Alexander the Great subdued the Valley of Peshawar during his invasion of the Indus Valley,[45] as well as the nearby Swat and Buner valleys.[46] Following Alexander's conquest, the Valley of Peshawar came under the suzerainty of Seleucus I Nicator, founder of the Seleucid Empire. A locally-made vase fragment that was found in Peshawar depicts a scene from Sophocles' play Antigone.[47]
